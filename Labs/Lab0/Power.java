1) Java is statically typed (we declared long result); Python is dynamically typed.
2) Java programs must be compiled to bytecode and run on the JVM; Python is interpreted by the Python runtime.
3) Java code must be inside a class with a main method to run; Python can run top-level statements in a .py file.
